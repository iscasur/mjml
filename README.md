# MJML ðŸ“©

The only framework that makes responsive email easy.

`MJML` is a markup language created by Mailjet and designed to reduce the pain of coding a responsive email. Its semantic syntax makes the language easy and straightforward while its rich standard components library shortens your development time and lightens your email codebase. MJMLâ€™s open-source engine takes care of translating the MJML you wrote into responsive HTML.
